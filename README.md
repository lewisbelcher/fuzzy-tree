Fuzzy Tree
==========

A simple fuzzy finder written in Rust which displays results in tree format.

Example tree (used in tests):

```
  .
├──   A
├──   B
├──   src
│   └──   cakes
│       ├── a.c
│       └── b.c
└── x.txt
```

Contributing
------------

Contributions are very welcome! Feel free to fork and open MRs (PRs in GitHub
speak). My only preferences are:
* MRs are concise and relevant.
* Code is formatted according to `rustfmt`.
* Relevant tests are implemented/updated.
